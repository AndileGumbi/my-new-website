      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>We don`t always feel 100% secure about every aspect of our body, our intellect, our relationships, etc. With social media we can become obsessive and feel more and more pressured to obtain <q cite="">perfection</q>. Beauty and the body are the biggest insecurities reported on a daily, especially by women. Social meadia reflects on beauty by being light-skinned and having clear skin, the body by being skinny and having curves, such things result to feeling inadequate and insecure, we end up bleaching ourselves, having plastic surgeries and suffering from working-out very hard and not eating to achieve a certain body type and beauty. <br>In reality we are not perfect. We have different skin tones, body types, areola sizes, we have dark spot and we also have stretch marks. We all need to embrace our flaws and differences.</p>

      <h3>Mind</h3>
      <p>Personally I think clothing helps with boosting ones confidence. Not only does it influence the level of confidence but also signifies how others perceive you. A certain style makes you happy and captures rapid attention. Some people use clothing as a way to hide their insecurities, but i think we should all feel comfortable in our own skin.<br>I say show the people all your flaws and embrace them, do not hide them, do not feel embarrassed and ashamed of your imperfections. Instead make your insecurities/ imperfections appear sexy and naughty. It is the imperfections in our work that enables it to be great, to allow changes, improvements and growth.</p>
